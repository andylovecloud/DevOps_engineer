# What is a Container? Why do we need a Container?

Suppose one fine day your boss assigned you the task of installing a new software on the company's production server, you carefully researched the necessary libraries and runtimes of this software and downloaded them all.

On the day of implementation, the first thing you will do is backup the server (of course â˜º ). You install a library Jxxx version 20, but during the installation process Jxxx says that two parallel versions cannot exist on the same machine and you must remove the older version first. You remove the old version Jxxx 19 from the machine and install Jxxx 20 (newer is of course better).

After completing the software installation, you inform your boss that the job is done.

30 minutes later, the customer calls and claims that some software that has been working normally until now cannot be started today and gives an error of missing a library. 

And then.... T.T
