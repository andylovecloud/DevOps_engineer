# Introduction
**Git** is a popular version control system (VCS) used to track changes in source code during software development. Git was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and quickly became an important tool for developers.

Git helps development teams work together on the same project without having to conflict different versions of the source code. It helps track the history of changes, manage branches to develop multiple features or fixes simultaneously, and has the ability to rollback to previous versions of the project.
