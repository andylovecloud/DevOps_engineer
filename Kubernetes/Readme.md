By following the instruction from my online teacher https://github.com/hoanglinhdigital/devops-for-beginner, I'm exploring my Kubernetes's knowledge with hand-on labs.

## What is Container Orchestration?
Container Orchestration is the process of automating the deployment, management, scaling, migration, and monitoring of containers. Technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Mesos
are designed to help with container management.
Specific tasks that container orchestration can perform include:
• Managing the lifecycle of containers
• Providing automatic scaling.
• Providing recovery.
• Load balancing across containers
• Providing communication channels between containers (Networking).
• Providing security mechanisms for containers (Security).
• Managing resource allocation for containers.
